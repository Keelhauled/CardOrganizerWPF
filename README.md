# CardOrganizerWPF
Card organizer for games made by Illusion

## Installation
1. Make sure BepInEx is installed on your game.
2. Download the latest release from [here](https://github.com/Keelhauled/CardOrganizerWPF/releases).
3. Drop the dll files you want into the `BepInEx` folder inside your game folder.
4. Run CardOrganizerWPF.exe from any folder.
5. Choose the UserData folder from the game you want to manage.

## Usage instructions
Context menus can be used to load/replace/delete and otherwise manage the cards.  
Change target to choose which scene to send the card to.

Hold left control and click on a category to select it and then hold lctrl and click on cards to move them to that category.  
When dragging cards into the program the cards are copied by default. Holding left shift lets you move them instead.

## Known issues
- Cards get mixed up if the game profile is switched when the program is still loading cards
